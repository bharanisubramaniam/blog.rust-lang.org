## What is Iter0

Iter0 is my attempt to distil the experience of evaluating software solutions - frameworks, libraries, utilities or platforms. I don't claim my evaluation to be complete but it should be good enough to get things started. No solution is perfect and can meet all the requirements so I evaluate on the important aspects that form the foundation of the system I am considering to build. 


## Why bother to document it here?

I always wanted to write it down and I am glad I finally did.
